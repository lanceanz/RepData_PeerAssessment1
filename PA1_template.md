Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment One
--------------------------------------------
Hello fellow student,  

Due to urgent admission to hospital last week I'm only able
to submit this manually-edited file to complete the very 
first requirements of the assignment (there's no R in this hospital!).

All the best with your study. 


## Loading and preprocessing the data



## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
